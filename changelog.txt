Main Features:
  - Added product pages to Best Sellers and Bundles
    - Product pages consist of a grid component made to dynamically add cards that dynamically
      update with content from a mock list
      - Mock list exports multiple product lists, so the grid layout has multiple components with different
        selectors so when a page uses a grid, it specifies it by the selector made for said page so
        it pulls the appropriate content from the mock list
    - Product page is split into six columns that are evenly spaced which populate using an ngFor loop which wraps
      every six product cards per row
